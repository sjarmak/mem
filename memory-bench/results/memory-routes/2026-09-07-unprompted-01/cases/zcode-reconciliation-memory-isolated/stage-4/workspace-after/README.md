# Northbank reconciliation

A small offline CLI for marketplace operations. It reads one JSON request from
stdin and writes one JSON response to stdout. Requires Python 3.10+ and only the
standard library. Run `python3 cli.py`; run public tests with
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`.

The available operation is `reconcile`. A month is `YYYY-MM`. Active reports
(`reconcile` and `refunds_csv`) use the finance ledger month: it starts at
05:00:00 UTC on the month's first calendar date (included) and ends at 05:00:00
UTC on the first calendar date of the next month (excluded), fixed at 05:00 UTC
year-round with no daylight-saving shift. Include payments and refunds posted
in that window, subtract refunds from payments, and return IDs ordered by
posting instant then lexicographically by ID. `incident_replay` remains frozen
on the earlier complete UTC calendar month for support comparisons.

```json
{"op":"reconcile","month":"2025-02"}
```

The default input is `fixtures/ledgerlake_snapshot.json`. Requests may instead
include `transactions`, an array with the same row shape as the snapshot. An
empty array means no rows. This override is part of the supported CLI contract
and makes customer examples reproducible without editing files.

```json
{"op":"reconcile","month":"2025-02","transactions":[{"id":"p-1","kind":"payment","posted_at":"2025-02-12T12:00:00Z","amount_cents":1250}]}
```

Response:

```json
{"month":"2025-02","transaction_ids":["p-1"],"payment_total_cents":1250,"refund_total_cents":0,"net_total_cents":1250}
```

Input guarantees: valid month years 2000–2099; unique IDs; valid timezone-aware
timestamps with `Z` or numeric offsets and at most millisecond precision;
`kind` is `payment` or `refund`; integer cents are nonnegative. Unknown extra
row fields may be ignored. Invalid-input behavior is outside this exercise.
No success logs belong on stdout. JSON key order is immaterial.

The adapter contract and a worked response are in
`provider_docs/transactions.md`.

Product issues include public JSON examples. Run an issue's examples with
`python3 test_public.py --cases /path/to/stage_N.json`.
