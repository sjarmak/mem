"""mem-eg850 — the OFFLINE half of E1: the guidance ladder, the argv it moves, and the gates.

Nothing here spends anything: every test drives the ladder table, `argv_for`, and the gate
arithmetic directly. The paid halves (the top-rung mechanism preflight and the staged fire) are
wired in `membench.runner.e1_grid` and are the orchestrator's to trigger; what is tested here is
the PLUMBING around them — the argv they will send, the halt logic they will apply to a result,
and the priced plan they disclose.
