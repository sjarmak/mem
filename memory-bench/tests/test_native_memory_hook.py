"""The PreToolUse interception: does the harness see a native-memory reach as it happens, and can
it answer that reach with the bd verbs instead?

Every test here drives the hook the way the CLI would — a JSON payload on stdin of the script that
was actually installed — rather than calling `hook_decision` in-process. The script body, the
`sys.path` it re-enters this package through, and the settings entry that points the CLI at it are
each part of the mechanism, and a test that skipped them would pass for a hook the CLI could not
run."""
