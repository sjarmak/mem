"""§4.4 trajectory driver — run an arm over a sequence's steps and emit the
`ArmStepTrajectory`s the action-impact harness scores.

This is the seam between the real-run substrate (`HeadlessClaudeAgent`, the producer)
and the deterministic scorer (`metrics.action_impact_run`, the consumer). For each
step it asks the agent to act under the arm's surfaced memory, derives the
`AttemptStep` tool-call trajectory from the agent's raw stream via
`bbon.extract.steps_from_stream`, and wraps it as an `ArmStepTrajectory`.

Per-arm memory is supplied by the caller as ``memory_for_step`` — the harness already
owns the none/ours/builtin retrieval (`runner.conditions` computes ``available_memory``
from each arm's `MemorySystem.retrieve`), so this driver does NOT re-implement it. The
``none`` control is simply the provider that returns ``{}`` for every step.

ZFC: pure mechanism — iteration, delegation to the injected agent, structural
extraction. No semantic judgment; the trajectory IS the agent's behavior.
