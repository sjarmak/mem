"""Run a PROJECT — a list of sequences sharing one memory store (§Continuity).

``run_sequence`` resets the store per sequence, so memory never crosses task
boundaries. ``run_project`` instead runs every sequence under ONE per-condition
scope without resetting between them, so a later task can read what an earlier task
wrote — the cross-task continuity the benchmark targets. It reuses ``run_sequence``'s
extracted ``_execute_step`` (identical step semantics); the only difference is the
shared scope and a unioned oracle pool.

Additive by design: ``run_sequence`` is untouched. A project whose later tasks
depend on an earlier task's memory passes under ``run_project`` but fails under
isolated ``run_sequence`` — that gap IS the continuity signal.
