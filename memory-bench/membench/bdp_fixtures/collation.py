"""The collation family: identifier spellings that separate comparison rules.

The seven graph families spell every Bead id as fixed-width lowercase hex and
every Link id as a zero-padded ordinal, so codepoint order over the canonical
URI, bytewise UTF-8 order, numeric order and case-insensitive order all agree.
That is deliberate there: it makes the reference order a clean total order and
keeps those families about membership and page arithmetic. It also means an
authority that compares numerically, that folds case, that ignores punctuation,
or that percent-decodes and normalizes before comparing passes all seven without
ever being asked the question.

This family asks it. Every identifier here is authored rather than generated,
because the identifiers are the payload. Four groups, each spelling out one axis
on which two comparison rules disagree:

    unpadded-ordinals   `2` after `10`, which numeric comparison reverses
    mixed-case          `Zeta` before `alpha`, which case folding reverses
    punctuation         `alpha-two` before `alpha_one`, which a collator that
                        treats punctuation as ignorable reverses
    normalization       one label percent-encoded from NFC and from NFD, which
                        percent-decoding reorders and normalizing ties

The reference order is ascending by Unicode code point over the canonical URI as
written: no percent-decoding, no Unicode normalization, no case folding, no
numeric parsing. Every identifier in this family is ASCII, so a bytewise UTF-8
comparison and a codepoint comparison cannot disagree; the non-ASCII appears
only inside percent-encoding, which is where a URI is allowed to carry it.

Two kinds of finding come out of this, and they are worth separating.

A comparison rule that ties two distinct ids is not a total order, so it fails
gastownhall/bdp#8's first clause outright, whatever order the authority
documents: two records that compare equal can be served twice or not at all
across a page boundary. Case folding, punctuation-ignoring collation and NFC
normalization all tie ids in this family.

A comparison rule that is a total order but a different one is conformant under
bdp#8 as proposed, which leaves the choice of order to the implementation. It is
detectable only against an authority that documents this family's order.
Numeric-aware comparison and percent-decoding comparison are both of these.

That split is the point of the family. It says which collation mistakes are
protocol violations and which are merely undocumented choices, and bdp#8's
"documents the order it uses" clause is only meaningful once the difference is
written down.
