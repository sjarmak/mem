"""Emit the BDP conformance fixture tree.

    uv run python -m membench.bdp_fixtures --out fixtures/bdp/ordering-families

Re-running over an existing tree is the determinism check: the output is a pure
function of the family names and this package's own seed, so a clean `git diff`
after a re-emit is the evidence, and a dirty one is a defect.

The emitter also deletes documents it could have written at that exact path but
did not, so a removed family cannot leave stale files behind and still show a
clean diff. Ownership is decided on the whole relative path, never on the
basename, and every deletion is printed.
