"""Render one generated graph family into BDP Bead / Link / Type records.

Pure functions over an edge list from `topologies`. No IO, no randomness, no
reads of any corpus: the same family name must produce byte-identical output on
every machine, which is what makes these usable as conformance fixtures rather
than as a snapshot of one run.

One node becomes one Bead; one generated edge becomes one first-class Link
record with a `cites` Link Type, because BDP Links are not embedded in either
endpoint.

Nothing here reads the frozen ordering corpus. Three earlier revisions of this
package projected it, and each review round found the answer key in whatever
field still looked innocuous: the prose, then the character lengths of the
withheld prose, then `lifecycle` and `provenance`, and finally the adjacency
itself, which no neutralization can reach. `topologies` carries that history and
the measurements behind it.

What survives from that work is the discipline about identifiers. Bead local ids
are digests of a generator-side node name rather than the node index, so the
published id space is not an ordinal enumeration; Link ordinals are assigned
after sorting on the published endpoints, so a Link id is a function of the
published graph and not of the order edges were generated in. Neither is load
bearing for secrecy now. Both are load bearing for the ordering claim: they keep
ids fixed-width, so codepoint order over the canonical URI is a clean total
order, and they keep the reference order independent of construction order.

Serialization order is deliberately NOT the reference order; see
`serialization_order`.
