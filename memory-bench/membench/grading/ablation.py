"""Ablation outcome source — the env-independent, always-feasible grading family.

Ablation needs no ground-truth label: it varies *which information the agent can
access* across an information ladder and reads the score-vs-information curve (the
saturation point and the minimum-useful combination). Because the agent is its own
control, it sidesteps the flaky per-rig env reconstruction the merged-diff source
needs (Stephanie, 2026-06-08).

This bead (mem-apg.1) ships the feasibility + the label-free ladder *design*; the
grid *execution* is mem-apg.3.
