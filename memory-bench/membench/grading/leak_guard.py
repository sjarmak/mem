"""Outcome-label leak guard — the task-construction mirror of `validity.assert_no_leak`.

D6 (`validity`) guards what an arm may ingest at *retrieval* time. It does not
cover the *task-construction* path, where an outcome label can reach the agent
through `instruction.md` or verifier markers (`harbor/adapter.py`). This guard
closes that path mechanically: given the files an agent can read and a task's
outcome-label values, assert none of the labels appears in agent-readable text
(architect finding C1).

Only high-entropy *identifiers* (pr, commit_sha, base_commit) are scanned — the
answer-revealing values a held-out bead must not expose. The low-entropy enum states
(pr_state / ci) are excluded by design: a task instruction may legitimately contain
the word "pass" or "merged", so substring-scanning them would be false positives.
`repo` (owner/name) is also excluded deliberately: it is legitimate task *context*
(the agent needs to know where the work lives), not an answer-revealing outcome, and
scanning it would false-positive on any task that names its own repository. Enum and
context leakage are prevented structurally by the design/task manifest split, not by
this scan.
