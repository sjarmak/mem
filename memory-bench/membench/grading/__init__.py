"""Outcome/grading sources + the coverage probe (mem-apg.1).

The verifier oracle is a FAMILY of sources (Stephanie, 2026-06-08): `merged_diff`
(the locked headline, where constructible) and `ablation` (env-independent, always
feasible). `OutcomeSource` is the uniform feasibility contract they share; the
coverage probe surveys which source can grade each held-out task before any Docker
or paid run. Named `grading` (not `oracle`) to avoid colliding with the existing
`OracleMemory` memory-ceiling condition (architect finding H3).
