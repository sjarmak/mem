"""E3a headline — write→later-read CLOSURE, and the first headline consumer of
``score_retrieval`` / ``score_retention``.

One seed = one three-step world (``generators.e3_closure_world``) driven through
``runner.conditions.run_sequence``. The endpoint is the B step's reward: closure
holds for a seed iff the apply step deployed with the pin an EARLIER step wrote.
``closure_rate`` is the Bernoulli mean over seeds.

The lattice this module exists to establish, before any arm is compared:

- **CEILING** — ``ScriptedAgent`` on an id-exact arm must reach ``closure_rate ==
  1.0``. Anything less means the fixture, not the arm, is the finding; the run
  reports ``halt: true`` and the CLI exits non-zero rather than printing an
  uninterpretable number.
- **FLOOR** — ``NeverWritesAgent`` on the same write-bearing arm must reach ``0.0``.
  That is what proves closure measures the WRITE and not the prompt.

Honest absences, carried in the summary rather than silently reported as zeros:

- ``supersession_correct`` / ``stale_memory_removed`` are UNMEASURABLE here. The
  ``MemorySystem`` ABC has no removal op, so ``removed_ids`` is always empty and
  passing ``superseded_expected_ids`` would flip both fields from constant-True to
  constant-FALSE for every arm — a fabricated penalty, not a measurement. The
  channel that still separates a read-everything arm from a compliant one is the
  outcome check's forbidden-value list, and it is read through the reward.
- ``correct_scope_rate`` is a pass-through default in the deterministic path (no
  arm here distinguishes scope), so it is reported as unmeasured, not as a 1.0 win.

Four further disclosures ride the summary so no number here is read as more than it
is (see the constants below for the emitted text):

- EVERY reported retrieval field is ANSWER-KEY CUED (``ANSWER_KEY_CUE``): on this
  fixture no retrieval field discriminates among arms that honor ``requested_ids``;
  only a NON-COMPLIANT read-everything arm moves any of them;
- ``forbidden_write_rate`` is a channel no wired agent exercises
  (``FORBIDDEN_WRITE_NOT_EXERCISED``);
- the floor is an ID-PRESENCE short-circuit, so non-id-keyed arms score 0 by
  construction (``FLOOR_IS_ID_PRESENCE``);
- a control-condition arm performs zero writes, so its ceiling is not a closure
  (``CONDITION_CAVEAT``).

Validity gates ride THIS summary, never a per-cell metric vector: a gate folded into
a per-seed vector flattens into the paired mean and stops being a gate.
