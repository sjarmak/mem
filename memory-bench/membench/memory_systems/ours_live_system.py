"""`ours-live` — the LIVE analog of the replay-only `ours` arm (mem-mtqi).

`OursMemory` (replay-only, `supports_write=False`) retrieves over a frozen
work-audit graph for a closed query work `B`. `OursLiveMemory` keeps that exact
retrieval path (it subclasses `OursMemory`, so READ is unchanged and failure-
triggered) but adds the forward-capture WRITE leg: at the deterministic capture
points the harness already detects (build / test / lint outcomes + `file:line`
errors, surfaced as a harness `write`), it EMITS a `memory_event` through the
single firewalled writer — the canonical `mem memory-event record` CLI — tagged
`source='forward-capture'`. It NEVER writes the SQLite `memory_events` table from
Python and NEVER ports the TS schema: the CLI is the only path into the store, so
the TS `MemoryEventSchema.strict()` allow-list governs every captured field.

Boundary discipline:

- READ delegates to `OursMemory.retrieve` — same LOO-bounded, replay-only
  retrieval; the harness re-checks its output against the boundary.
- WRITE shells the CLI; a failed emit RAISES (never a silent "no capture").
- `supports_write = True`, so the harness routes captures here. Because the base
  `OursMemory.write` raises, `seed()` is overridden to a no-op — harness distractor
  seeding must never emit a forward-capture event (that is environment state the
  harness owns, not an agent capture; mem-zt1c).

SCOPE (YAGNI): the pilot stays at failure-triggered capture — the same events
replay-only `ours` is scored on. It does NOT broaden to capture every tool call.

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT: a runnable live arm needs a `mem_bin` (or an injected
`emit_runner`) so it can reach the CLI; the factory builds it with neither, so a
factory-built `ours-live` retrieves fine but RAISES on the first capture
`write()`. The runnable path is the conditions-runner `override=` injection seam
(which supplies the wired arm). The `MEMBENCH_MEMORY_SYSTEM` pilot values are
`none | ours` (replay), NOT `ours-live`, so the env-override path never silently
selects an unwired live arm.
