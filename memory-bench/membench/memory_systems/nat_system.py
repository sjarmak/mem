"""`nat` — the NeMo Agent Toolkit competitive arm (mem-lvp.3).

`NatMemory` is a pure ``name`` + ``backend`` subclass of ``AbstractSemanticArm``;
all the translation lives in ``_NatClient``, which adapts NAT's async
``nat.memory.interfaces.MemoryEditor`` to the SYNC ``SemanticMemoryClient`` seam
through an injected ``AsyncClientBridge`` (mem-lvp.5a) — ``MemoryEditor`` is async,
the Protocol is not, so the bridge holds one persistent loop and the seam (and the
fakes) stay sync.

- ``store`` -> ``add_items([MemoryItem(user_id=scope, memory=content, metadata=...)])``.
  ``MemoryItem`` has NO native id field, so the adapter mints its own id and
  round-trips it through ``metadata['memory_id']``; that minted id is returned and
  is what retrieval keys its payloads off.
- ``query`` -> ``search(query, top_k, user_id=scope)``; maps ``MemoryItem.memory`` ->
  content and reads the minted id back out of ``metadata``. RedisEditor's
  ``similarity_score`` is an L2/Euclidean **distance** (lower = closer), so the
  adapter normalizes it to a higher-is-better similarity via ``1 / (1 + d)`` — the
  same convention the A-MEM arm uses, so the base ranks every arm identically. When
  the backend omits the score (it is optional on ``MemoryItem``) the hit carries
  ``None`` and the base trusts the editor's list order.
- ``clear`` -> ``remove_items(user_id=scope)``; scrubs one scope only, never resets
  the whole store across trials.

The real ``RedisEditor`` (redis-stack + a local sentence-transformers embedder, no
paid API) is built LAZILY in ``default_nat_client`` so importing this module — and
the whole test suite — needs neither the SDK nor a live Redis. Tests inject a fake.
