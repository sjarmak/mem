"""AsyncClientBridge — a sync wrapper around a persistent asyncio event loop, so an
async-native backend client (NAT ``MemoryEditor``, Graphiti) can satisfy the SYNC
``SemanticMemoryClient`` Protocol (see semantic_base.py) without making the seam — or
the deterministic fakes — async.

The loop is held across many sequential ``run`` calls so the backend's Redis/graph-
driver connection lifecycle stays warm (``asyncio.run`` per call would tear that down
every time). The loop is created with ``new_event_loop()`` and never installed as the
thread's current loop (no ``set_event_loop``): each bridge owns EXACTLY ONE loop on
its instance, never a shared/global/module-level one. That isolation is load-bearing —
the mem-lvp.12 concurrency audit (failure mode #5) found a shared loop is both a global
serialization point and a shared-connection contamination vector across trials/arms.

    One loop per instance, owned for the instance's lifetime. ``close`` (or exiting
    the context manager) tears the loop down; ``run`` after that raises rather than
    silently spinning up a replacement.

    Not thread-safe: calls must be sequential. ``run_until_complete`` rejects
    re-entrant or concurrent use of the same loop, which matches the harness's
    one-bridge-per-arm, serial-trial execution model.

    We deliberately do NOT delegate to ``asyncio.Runner`` despite the overlap:
    ``Runner`` calls ``events.set_event_loop()`` on init, reintroducing the
    thread-global current-loop mutation the mem-lvp.12 audit (failure mode #5)
    requires us to avoid. ``close`` replicates only its teardown sequence, never
    its global-state side effect.
