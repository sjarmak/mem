"""`a-mem` — the A-MEM competitive arm (mem-lvp.9).

A-MEM (``agentic_memory.AgenticMemorySystem``) is an LLM-augmented vector store:
each note is embedded into ChromaDB and linked to related notes via a local LLM.
Against this harness it is the same translation as every semantic arm — ``write``
-> ``add_note``, ``retrieve`` -> ``search``, ``reset`` -> drop the scope — so the
arm itself only sets ``name`` + ``backend`` and inherits ``AbstractSemanticArm``.

The backend specifics live in ``_AMemClient``:

- A-MEM mints its own UUID per note and ignores any caller id, so the adapter
  keeps a per-scope ``{memory_id: minted_id}`` side map and returns the minted id
  (which retrieval then keys its payloads off).
- ``search`` returns ChromaDB hits whose score is an L2 **distance** (lower =
  closer); the adapter normalizes it to a higher-is-better similarity so the base
  ranks every arm identically.
- Per-scope (per-trial) isolation is modelled the way the real reset works —
  rebuild the instance with a fresh ``collection_name`` and empty ``memories`` —
  but the adapter holds one native instance per scope so ``clear(scope)`` wipes
  only that scope.

The real ``AgenticMemorySystem`` (ChromaDB embedded + sentence-transformers +
Ollama LLM) is built LAZILY inside the default factory, so this module imports
with no SDK installed and the suite stays green under the no-paid-API contract.
