"""Consolidation lifecycle: the ``ConsolidationCapable`` Protocol + its result (S1).

``run_sequence`` isinstance-checks this Protocol to decide whether an arm gets an
offline ``consolidate()`` pass after the per-step write loop — the exact
ClosableClient pattern (``semantic_base.py``): a separate runtime-checkable
Protocol, so the core ``MemorySystem`` ABC stays at its method count (the §5b
no-widening rule). Only arms that actually consolidate implement it; everything
else is skipped.

The subtractive primitive is ``tombstone`` — a SOFT delete that keeps the row
re-derivable. There is deliberately no hard-delete on this Protocol: the
reversibility invariant (M7) says every forgetting op is reversible until archived,
and the provenance gate dereferences the citations a consolidated item leaves
behind. ``background_tokens`` is the honest offline LLM cost (M6) — 0 for the
deterministic CI summarizer, ``> 0`` once a real model fills the cluster summary.
