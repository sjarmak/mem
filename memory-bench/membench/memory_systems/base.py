"""The uniform memory-system (arm) interface.

The harness drives every system identically: it owns the record set, the scope,
the LOO boundary, and telemetry; the system only implements `retrieve` and
`write` and reports each as a normalized `MemoryEvent` (§6.2). This is the same
uniform-arm contract promoted as ARCHITECTURE.md Decision 11, and the seam the
competitive arms (a-mem / mem0 / graphiti / nat, mem-lvp) plug into later without
re-touching it.

`retrieve` takes a single `RetrievalRequest` so one signature serves both arm
families:

- **id-based reference arms** (`oracle`, `filesystem`) use `query_text` +
  `requested_ids` — exact-by-id recovery over what earlier steps wrote.
- **failure-triggered arms** (`ours`, and the competitive arms) use `query_work`
  + `scope` — retrieval over the work-audit graph under the harness-owned LOO
  boundary (Decision 6/8). The harness, not the arm, fixes the boundary; the
  arm's output is re-checked against it (`validity.assert_no_leak`).
