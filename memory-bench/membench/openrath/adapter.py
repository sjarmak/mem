"""Pure projecting adapter: an OpenRath `Session` -> mem's existing field-separated
types (a provenance `cut` event, typed `MemoryEvent` records, and a `WorkRecord`
with named join keys).

OpenRath (arXiv 2606.19409) makes agent runtime state a first-class composable
`Session`. mem adopts it at EXACTLY ONE boundary — this one-direction projector —
and never persists or carries a Session forward (PRD
`docs/prd-openrath-incorporation.md`, Phase 1). The design rule is an
ALLOW-LIST, not a deny-list: every output is built from an enumerated set of input
fields, and an unrecognized top-level Session field RAISES — a silently dropped
field is an unaudited exfiltration channel the firewall was never told about
(PRD Risk #2 / firewall #5).

Field routing is the load-bearing validity invariant. The held-out outcome label
(`lineage.commit_sha`) is routed into `outcome.commit_sha` ONLY — never into the
agent-readable `title` or any other column — so the EXISTING
`grading.leak_guard` / `WorkRecordLadderAdapter` firewall (not a parallel one)
catches it mechanically if a mis-projection lets it escape. The runtime
`fork_point` is legitimate provenance and rides into a `cut` event; the
memory-event payload is field-separated out into typed `MemoryEvent`s and is
never folded into the WorkRecord.

ZFC: deterministic projection + structural (allow-list / charset / length) checks
only — no semantic judgment in code.
