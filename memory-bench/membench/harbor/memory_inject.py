"""Per-rung memory CONTENT injection into an ablation task dir (mem-apg.3d).

mem-apg.2's `WorkRecordLadderAdapter` emits the per-rung information SPEC -- which
memory each rung MAY access -- but writes no memory content (architect-H4 gap). This
module closes it: given a rung's resolved memory payloads, it writes the actual
agent-readable memory file into the task dir.

The payloads themselves are resolved by the driver (`grid.run_grid`), which calls
the `ours` arm under the task's LOO boundary (D6) and supplies the oracle's
ground-truth prior. This module is pure mechanism (ZFC): it writes IO and runs the
leak guards; it makes no retrieval and no semantic judgment.

Two guards run before any write, so a leak aborts with nothing on disk:

- `assert_no_outcome_leak` (the mem-apg.1 task-construction guard) -- no high-entropy
  outcome identifier (pr / commit_sha / base_commit) may reach agent-readable text.
- the `oracle`-only H3 self-leak guard -- the oracle payload must NOT contain the
  held-out bead's OWN `trace_error` signature (full or relaxed), because that
  signature is exactly the answer the deterministic scorer (mem-apg.3a) checks.
  Leaking it would let the agent trivially "avoid" the failure it was handed.

H3 parity for the OURS payloads (mem-tnyo): the same relaxed-signature scan runs
over the retrieval payloads too, but as a recorded COVARIATE
(`signature-overlap.json`), never a hard guard -- see `write_signature_overlap`
for the guard-vs-covariate justification.

`builtin` / `ours+builtin` depend on the agent's opaque built-in memory (the paid
Harbor path owned by mem-whi) and are DEFERRED -- injecting them is not this bead's
job, so they raise `DeferredRungError` rather than silently writing nothing.
