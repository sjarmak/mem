"""Graded fail-to-pass repro for ftp-oracle anchor bundles (mem-bxhh.3.3).

`repro_live.LiveReproRunner` scores whole gold-test FILES on the host (npm/vitest);
a codeprobe ftp anchor bundle (mem-bxhh.3.2) instead carries a curated red->green
NODE-ID set on ``verification.ftp_oracle`` that pytest must run IN the rig
container. This runner is the `ReproRunner` the dual verifier / validity gate inject
for those bundles. For one candidate diff it:

1. checks out a detached worktree of the rig clone at the bundle's ``env.base_commit``
   (the ftp oracle's PARENT), cached per (rig, base_commit) and reset between runs;
2. ``git apply`` the candidate diff EXCLUDING the gold test MODULES -- the curated
   tests are the spec, never judged on the candidate's own test edits;
3. overlays the LANDING versions of those gold test modules (``git checkout landing
   -- <modules>``) -- the same parent-source/landing-tests isolation
   ``ftp_curate.curate_commit`` mined the oracle with;
4. runs exactly the curated ftp nodeids in ``bundle.env.base_image`` and counts how
   many pytest reports as ``passed``.

``passed`` = every curated ftp nodeid passes (the ungameable all-or-nothing anchor);
``tests_passed`` / ``tests_total`` are the S1 per-nodeid partial credit underneath it
(mem-g6a). Because the scored run reuses ftp_curate's container-pytest primitive, a
candidate is scored on the same install + junit instrument the oracle was curated
with -- so the validity gate's gold-reproduces / empty-fails invariant holds by
construction for a sound oracle.

An infrastructure failure (the candidate diff will not apply, the landing overlay
failed, the container produced no junit) returns ``ReproOutcome(error=...)`` so
`score_direct` falls back to diff similarity and records WHY -- never a silent 0.

ZFC: pure mechanism -- git IO (injectable `Runner`), container exec, junit set ops.
The one judgement (do the tests pass?) is pytest's, delegated like the curator's.
