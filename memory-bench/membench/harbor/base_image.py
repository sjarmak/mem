"""harbor/base_image -- build a cached, dependency-baked base image (mem-bxhh.3.1).

Codeprobe graded/curation runs re-run ``pip install -e . pytest`` on every leg
(ftp_curate ``_container_pytest``); cold, that resolves and builds the whole
dependency closure each time. This builds a ``codeprobe-base`` image once with
that closure baked into the image's ``/usr/local/lib`` site-packages. The image's
deps survive a later ``-v <worktree>:/app`` mount (different path), so the runtime
``pip install -e . pytest`` finds them satisfied -- no downloads -- and does only
the cheap editable re-link for that commit's tree.

This is NOT a Docker build-layer cache trick: the win is deps physically present
in the image filesystem at run time. And it is OPT-IN -- callers pass the tag via
``--base-image``; the default stays the self-bootstrapping public
``python:3.11-bookworm`` so a fresh checkout / CI never fails on a missing local
image.

Known limitation (pilot scope): the closure is baked at one representative commit.
A later commit that adds a dependency self-heals via the network at runtime (the
runtime install is NOT ``--no-deps``), just slower for that leg -- it never
silently runs without the new dep.
