"""Approximate environment reconstruction for a held-out bead (mem-apg.3.1, D17).

The held-out corpus carries no ``repo``/``base_commit`` (0/76 beads -- see the data
audit), so a faithful checkout is impossible. What IS available: the rig name (which
maps to a local working clone) and the record's ``started_at`` timestamp. This module
reconstructs an APPROXIMATE environment from those two facts:

    rig -> local repo ; commit ~= `git rev-list -1 --before=<started_at> HEAD`

and bakes a snapshot of the repo at that commit into the task's ``environment/`` so
``harbor run`` builds an image with the code at ``/app``. This is deliberately
approximate (D17): the commit is the main-tip-before-timestamp, not the exact branch
state the original run saw (traces ran in worktrees off branch state), and the base
image's toolchain is a per-rig best-effort, not the original CI environment.

Why approximate is still useful: ``path_reached`` (the base-rate gate's denominator)
only needs the held file present at ``/app`` so the agent can navigate to it -- which a
timestamp-approximate checkout provides. Error *recurrence* additionally needs the
build/test toolchain, which is the residual faithfulness risk surfaced here, not hidden.
