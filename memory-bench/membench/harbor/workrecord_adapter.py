"""Emit a held-out WorkRecord as an ablation information-ladder of Harbor tasks.

One task dir per ablation rung (none / ours / builtin / ours+builtin / oracle). The
task the agent attempts is built ONLY from the record's label-free `title` — never
its `metadata` (which carries outcome signals like `evidence.commit_sha`) and never
its `outcome`. Every agent-readable file is checked with `assert_no_outcome_leak`
before write, so the D6 / leak invariant holds mechanically on the task-construction
path (mem-apg.1 finding C1).

This bead (mem-apg.2) emits the task skeleton + the per-rung information spec; the
per-rung memory CONTENT injection and the scoring are mem-apg.3. Env reconstruction
(merged-diff) is demoted to opportunistic and is not built here (ARCHITECTURE D17).
