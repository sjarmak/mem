"""Deterministic metric scorers (§12).

Pure mechanism (ZFC / patterns.md §ZFC): set arithmetic, ranking math, and counting
over what a trial actually produced. Fields that need a judge (rubric_score,
completion_quality, derailment_signal magnitude) are left at their None/default
seams by the callers.

The §12.6 action-impact scorer is the one orchestrated judge seam: its own code is
still pure mechanism (mechanical trajectory diff, prompt assembly, reply parsing),
but it calls an INJECTED comparative judge for the counterfactual booleans. No judge
=> the semantic axes stay None; the mechanical pre-filter still fills the axes the
trajectories prove unchanged.
