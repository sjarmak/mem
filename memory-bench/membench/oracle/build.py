"""Build a bundle's ``oracle_context`` from its gold diff (mem-75t.7.3, plan §4 P2).

This is the glue between the consensus/curator port and the bundle: codeprobe
mined an oracle for a stated symbol-reference task, but a mem bundle's task is a
bead, so the oracle SEED is the gold diff itself. Two tiers fall out:

- the gold-diff modified files are REQUIRED, unconditionally -- they were edited to
  produce the output, so the agent definitionally needed them (provenance
  ``gold_diff``, the most authoritative source);
- reference CONTEXT (files that reference the modified modules) is expanded per
  modified module and admitted ONLY when consensus ships (≥2 backends agree above
  the F1 threshold). A quarantined or single-backend symbol contributes no context
  -- this is the first-class precision guard the mem-75t.7.6 gate demanded: the
  probe measured unfiltered context REGRESSING a bundle (-0.09 combined, +138
  turns), so context enters the oracle only when a second backend vouches for it.

``max_oracle_files`` is the volume cap. Required files are never dropped (ground
truth); supplementary (Tier-2 LLM-kept) files are truncated first, lowest
provenance first, and the drop is LOGGED and counted, never silent.

ZFC: mechanism only -- the modified-file seed and consensus arithmetic are
deterministic; the sole semantic call is the curator's Tier-2 keep/reject, already
delegated to the model inside ``curator.py``.
