"""§11 Phase-1 — materialize a synthetic ``BenchmarkSequence`` into a corpus WorkRecord.

The synthetic generator (``generators.synthetic_task`` → ``BenchmarkSequence``, gated
by ``generators.memory_necessity_gate``) already exists; this module is the missing
wiring that turns its output into a DURABLE WorkRecord the eval consumes the SAME way
it consumes real work — ``corpus.load_corpus`` → ``validity.work_ref_from_record`` →
the temporal LOO guard. No bespoke synthetic loader, no second firewall, no second
reader.

D-J SHARE (Stephanie, mayor gc-408430): a synthetic record IS a WorkRecord in the
existing JSON projection, distinguished from a real one ONLY by ``origin="synthetic"``
(projected first-class by ``validity.WorkRef.origin``; real records project
``"real"``). One schema, one reader, one LOO path.

Field separation is load-bearing for validity: the ONLY outcome label a synthetic
record carries is the deterministic memory-necessity verdict (oracle-vs-no-memory
rewards), computed offline with no model — never a real bead's ``commit_sha`` / ``pr``
/ resolution. An optional high-entropy ``outcome_sentinel`` (a synthetic outcome
token, never a real SHA) is routed into the firewall-scanned ``outcome.commit_sha``
ONLY, so the EXISTING ``grading.leak_guard`` / ``WorkRecordLadderAdapter`` firewall
catches it mechanically if a mis-projection ever lets it reach agent-readable text.

ZFC: deterministic projection of authored ground truth — no semantic judgment.
