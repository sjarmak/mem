"""§11 — the synthetic task generator (Tier 0, pure Python).

The spec §11.2 three-stage pipeline, authored deterministically so CI never calls
a model (the package policy — see ``generators.__init__``):

  Stage 1 (blueprint)  : ``TaskBlueprint`` — a multi-step task plan whose early
                         steps ESTABLISH facts and whose goal step REQUIRES them.
  Stage 2 (steps)      : ``expand_blueprint`` turns each ``StepBrief`` into a
                         ``SequenceStep`` (the establishing write) and appends the
                         goal step that depends on every established fact.
  Stage 3 (schema)     : the same pass assigns seed-namespaced ids and emits the
                         deterministic ``BenchmarkSequence`` the runner consumes.

Memory-dependence is STRUCTURAL, not hoped-for: the goal step's ``OutcomeCheck``
requires every fact id an earlier step wrote, so the oracle condition (memory
available) passes it and the no-memory condition cannot. ``pilot_filter`` then
confirms that property held in a real pilot run before a task is admitted.

Given a seed the sequence is byte-reproducible: the seed selects a blueprint from
the authored bank and namespaces every id, and nothing else varies. A local model
may later enrich the surface prose offline into a frozen fixture, but the facts,
the dependency structure, and the ids are always ours.
