"""§11 enterprise-workflow materialiser (Tier 0, pure Python).

Turns a NeMo-generated ``EnterpriseWorld`` + ``Project`` (the surface/cast) into N
memory-dependent ``BenchmarkSequence``s. Mirrors ``synthetic_task`` but draws its
cast (personas, channels) from the world and authors a richer fact graph:

* establishing steps write authored "decision facts" attributed to world personas;
* one subject per task — its position varied by seed — is SUPERSEDED through a chain
  of ``SUPERSESSION_DEPTH`` versions under distinct ids; each superseding step marks
  its predecessor (the Staleness signal) and the goal depends on the FINAL version
  only;
* the goal step carries ``distractor_memories`` — plausible-but-wrong values for the
  same subjects (the Confusion signal);
* the goal's ``OutcomeCheck`` requires every current id AND forbids stating any
  superseded value (``forbidden_values``), so staleness is reward-bearing: an arm
  that surfaces a stale version fails the goal instead of only ticking the
  ``stale_memory_retrieval_rate`` diagnostic (mem-z3gi);
* no agent-visible string separates the classes (mem-z3gi): memory ids are opaque
  content-keyed hashes (``opaque_memory_id``), and truth / stale / distractor all
  render through the SAME ``_fact`` template — only the value (and the drawn
  attribution) differs. Labels live in harness-side fields only (step ids, probe
  descriptions), which the runner never shows the agent.

ZFC boundary (the generators policy): NeMo supplied only the cast and prose; every
fact, value, dependency, distractor and supersession here is authored in pure
Python and is seed-reproducible. ``distractor_memories`` / ``superseded_memory_ids``
are the authored ground truth the runner seeds + scores Confusion/Staleness
against (mem-zt1c); the values are deliberately absent from the goal query, so a
naive top-k retriever cannot rank the truth above a distractor — that hardness is
the point.
