"""Map real §8 ``Trace`` records into structural ``TaskFeatures`` (mem-28n5, mem-ovi.1).

Binding blocker for the STRUCTURAL axis of the realism metric (mem-ovi). The
synthetic corpus is reduced to a feature vector by
``features.features_from_sequence``; this module reduces the REAL corpus the SAME
way (``features.features_from_trace_steps``) so the cross-corpus KS distance in
``distance.structural_realism`` measures realism rather than a representation gap.

Two modeling decisions — the actual work, not glue — are resolved here, and a
fidelity finding is recorded for the run leg (mem-ovi.2).

Decision 1 — SESSION -> STEP segmentation (Fork B).
    A synthetic ``BenchmarkSequence`` is multi-step (one ``user_request`` per
    step); a real §8 ``Trace`` is one flat session (a single ``task_id`` /
    ``step_id`` with flat ``messages`` / ``tool_calls`` / ``memory_events``). Some
    segmentation rule is unavoidable — a structural vector cannot be computed at
    all without one — so the DEFAULT (``_turn_texts``) segments by USER TURN: one
    step per ``role == "user"`` message, in order. That makes ``n_steps`` the
    faithful analog of the synthetic per-request step count and
    ``task_text_length`` the same quantity (per-request text) on both sides. A
    session with no user messages falls back to its full message list, then to a
    single empty step. Like Fork A (corpus subset, ``mem_corpus.py``) and Fork C
    (``message_filter``, ``mem_corpus.py``), this default is injectable — every
    public function here takes a ``segmenter`` — so Stephanie's eventual call on
    an alternative segmentation does not require touching this module.

Decision 2 — MEMORY / TOOL feature fidelity.
    The §8 schema does NOT timestamp ``messages`` or ``tool_calls``, so a tool
    call or memory event cannot be attributed to the user turn that triggered it.
    Six of the seven features are nonetheless faithful because they are sums or
    set-unions over the whole session and so are invariant to how activity
    distributes across steps: ``n_steps`` (user turns), ``n_tool_calls``,
    ``tool_diversity``, ``n_memory_writes``, ``n_memory_reads``,
    ``task_text_length``. The seventh — ``dependency_depth`` — is NOT recoverable:
    it is a cross-step write->read chain, and without per-turn attribution it can
    only be fabricated or silently read as 0. It is therefore declared N/A on the
    real side (``RECOVERABLE_FEATURES`` excludes it — built from
    ``perfeature_reference``'s own signed-off ``MATCHABLE_FEATURES`` +
    ``MEMORY_OP_FEATURES`` split, which already excludes ``dependency_depth`` the
    same way; a caller still on the older full-vector ``distance.structural_realism``
    can restrict its own comparison to ``RECOVERABLE_FEATURES`` by hand).
    The actual memory-dependency depth that occurred in the session — over the
    timestamp-ordered memory events, a faithful but DIFFERENT-granularity measure
    — is exposed as a diagnostic by ``memory_dependency_depth`` so the finding is
    backed by data rather than asserted.

Tool-surface asymmetry (documented, accepted): the synthetic side counts
``available_tools`` (the offered surface) while the real side counts
``tool_calls[].name`` (the invoked surface), and the offered surface is >= the
invoked one. Both capture tool breadth; the asymmetry is reported, not hidden.

Source of real ``Trace`` records: this module is pure — its input is an iterable
of already-loaded ``Trace`` objects. Querying the live ``.mem`` substrate for the
real reference corpus, and parsing raw transcript JSONL into ``Trace`` objects,
is ``mem_corpus.py`` (the gated RUN leg, mem-ovi.2, stays out of this BUILD leg,
so the realism NUMBERS stay under the publication freeze).
