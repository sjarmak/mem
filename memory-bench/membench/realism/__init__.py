"""Synthetic-data realism metric (mem-ovi).

Quantifies how realistic a synthetic eval corpus is versus real agent traces, on
three independently-reported axes:

* STRUCTURAL  — mechanical distributional match of task shapes. The signed-off
  form (#mem 2026-06-21) is the per-feature KS vector in ``perfeature_reference``
  (matchable vs disjoint memory-op groups, no aggregate); ``distance`` keeps the
  earlier mean-of-7 aggregate for callers not yet migrated.
* SEMANTIC    — a model judge's per-task realism rating (``semantic``).
* CONSTRUCT   — rank-correlation of memory-arm performance, N-flagged (``construct``).

``report.assess_realism`` assembles the three into a `RealismReport` whose
``defensible`` flag is a transparent AND over the per-axis gates — never an opaque
composite. See ``report.py`` for the gating policy and the publication-freeze note.
